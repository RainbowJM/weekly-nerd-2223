Date: 17 February 2023

## Campspace
Susan Lau works at Campspace. 
Campspace connects outside of the digital world: 'it's for looking for a camping space. It's basically like an Airbnb but for camping'.

### Data
All of this data is in a database. 
She was also talking about using an .exe list within the database.
With data you can make your static HTML more dynamic and we can do that with templating.
What she was showing was how she was looping through the data.

### Backend
All of the sortering and filtering is happening in the backend.
The database uses one dimensional CSS.
They're using the framework Symphony.
They use elasticsearch. 
You can use different URL's for example for images. It helps you structure your data.
There are two types of datasets within elasticsearch: 
- Presentation 
- Filtering backend
