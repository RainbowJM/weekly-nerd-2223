Making websites work for everyone by Aaron Gustafson

## Making websites work for everyone
Aaron, the Principal Accessibility Innovation Strategist at Microsoft, discusses the importance of web accessibility and creating websites that cater to everyone's needs. 

To ensure that our websites are inclusive and functional for all users, we must consider the diverse range of user networks and conditions, including wifi, hardline, and mobile connections. 
It's crucial to recognize that the web experience is not uniform, as lower-class devices may perform differently than higher-class ones. 
Taking these factors into account is essential in making websites work for everyone.

Progressive enhancement or graceful degradation is a recommended practice for ensuring website accessibility. 
This approach involves starting with a solid foundation of basic functionality and then progressively adding enhancements. 
By developing in this manner, we guarantee that the core features of the website will function for all users, regardless of their device, while providing additional features for those with more advanced devices.

A useful analogy for progressive enhancement is the escalator. 
Similar to how an escalator always functions, even if it's not moving, a well-designed website should also work even if certain elements, such as JavaScript, are disabled. 
While the absence of advanced features may diminish the experience, the website should still be fully functional for all users.

Here are the recommended steps to follow when developing for the web:
1. Prioritize what matters: Focus on the most important elements of your website and address them first.
   This approach helps maintain focus, reduce unnecessary complexity, and ensure a smoother development process.

2. Plan and review: Before diving into coding, take the time to plan out your website and articulate your ideas in writing.
   Then, review your plan to ensure clarity and avoid overlooking critical aspects or introducing unnecessary complications.

3. Use semantic code: Employ HTML tags that accurately describe the content they contain, making it easier for all users to understand and navigate your website.

4. Leverage design to convey intent: Good design plays a crucial role in effectively communicating the purpose and message of your website to visitors.
   Utilize common design patterns and ensure that your design aligns with your intended goals.

5. Consider the impact of design choices on user experience: Design choices, including layout, color choices, and typography, greatly influence how users interact with your site.
   Reflect on how these elements affect usability and accessibility, aiming to create a positive user experience.

6. Account for diverse user interactions: Keep in mind that people will access your site using various devices, browsers, and platforms, with differing network speeds.
   Ensure that your website is responsive and accessible across multiple platforms, accommodating different screen sizes and input methods.

7. Iterate: Remember that web development is an iterative process.
   Be open to refining your website as you go, seeking opportunities for improvement and addressing any issues that arise.

By following these steps and incorporating inclusive design principles, we can create websites that are accessible, functional, and enjoyable for all users, regardless of their abilities, devices, or network conditions.
