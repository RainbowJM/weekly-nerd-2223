### Difference of school and work
Priority is on delivering product
Lots of ad-hoc stuff -> soft skills (learning to collaborate)
Tech debt builds up quickly
Mainly working on existing projects. 

When you get out of college you have most recent knowledge (advantage)

Design -> content -> test -> review

Design is delivered via a zeplin-link and an invision-link

Through a separate copy document 

Tester checks everything for design and copy errors and functionality 

Design acceptance test in which the flows are run through with the marketeers and designer (Start mobile first design

### Handoff could be better between design and developer. 
Tickets sent when something has to be adjusted

Consequences of wrong handoff:
- Wrong choice in technical foundation (through without additional explanation).
- Developers deviate from design (by not standardized formats)
- Time lost in conversion ( not sufficient file format )
- Doing it yourself is faster than inquiring(receive images cropped incorrectly)

Improvement:
- Being proactive
- Communicate
- Have a meeting about it with the team
