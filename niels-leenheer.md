Bridging the Gap Between Native and Web Applications by Niels Leenheer

## Bridging the Gap Between Native and Web Applications
Web applications have gained popularity among developers due to their ease of development. 
However, there have always been limitations regarding accessing the user's file system or hardware peripherals for security reasons. 

To address this, Project Fugu was introduced as an initiative to bridge the gap between native and web applications. 
Its goal is to provide web applications with access to a wide range of hardware functionalities, making them more powerful and viable.

One example of Project Fugu's usefulness is the File System Access API. 
Previously, web applications couldn't access a user's file system due to security restrictions. 
However, with the File System Access API, web applications can now securely access the file system, enabling the development of web-based text editors, image editors, and other applications requiring file system access. 
This breakthrough even made it possible to create a web-based version of Photoshop, which was unimaginable just a few years ago.

Project Fugu also extends its capabilities to interact with hardware peripherals like printers, barcode scanners, and cash drawers. 
These functionalities were previously limited to native applications, but now web applications can utilize them securely. 
Instead of developing separate native apps for each platform, web applications developed with Project Fugu can work across multiple platforms.

Regarding security, Niels, an advocate of Project Fugu, believes it is safe to use. 
Unlike native applications with unrestricted device access, web applications using Project Fugu are subject to browser security measures. 
By default, web applications don't have access to hardware functionalities, and explicit user consent is required to grant access. 
This makes Project Fugu in web applications arguably safer compared to downloading a native app and granting it unrestricted hardware access.
