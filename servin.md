3D on the web by Servin

## 3D on the web
Servin is a lead frontend developer at Level 30 Wizards, a creative digital studio. 
Additionally, he occasionally takes on fullstack development tasks. 
He is exploring the world of 3D on the web and focuses on Three.js.

When it comes to developing 3D experiences for the web, the HTML <canvas> element is commonly utilized. 
It provides a canvas where developers can paint specific pixels to construct intricate 3D scenes.

WebGL, a JavaScript API, plays a significant role in web development by enabling the rendering of interactive 2D and 3D graphics directly within web browsers. 
This eliminates the need for plugins and seamlessly integrates with web standards. 
WebGL empowers developers to incorporate GPU-accelerated physics, image processing, and effects into the canvas of web pages.

In the realm of 3D scenes, different types of cameras can be employed. 
These include the perspective camera, which offers a realistic visual perspective, and the orthographic camera, which presents a flat and consistent view without depth.

To enhance the ambiance and visual appeal of 3D scenes, developers can incorporate various types of lighting. 
These encompass ambient light, which provides overall illumination, directional light, which mimics sunlight, point light, which emanates from a specific point, and spotlights, which focus light in a specific direction.

While WebGL has been widely adopted, WebGPU represents an enhanced and evolving version that is currently under development. 
It promises advanced capabilities, although support for it by web browsers is not yet widespread.

Another technology on the horizon is WebXR, designed to facilitate the creation of websites for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices. 
However, similar to WebGPU, WebXR is still in development and not extensively supported by web browsers at present.

Servin's insights shed light on the exciting world of 3D on the web and highlight the tools and technologies that enable the development of immersive and interactive experiences.
