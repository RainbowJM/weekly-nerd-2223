VR on the web by Brain Bawuah

## VR on the web
Brian, an employee at Rockstars IT, specializes in virtual reality prototyping. 
His prototyping for his graduation project process begins with initial sketches on whiteboards or paper. 
He then proceeds to create a physical prototype using cardboard or paper, leveraging Arduino for its development. 
To further refine the prototype, Brian utilizes Blender, a 3D modeling software.

When it comes to converting the prototype into a web-based format, Brian recommends using either the HTML canvas element or the Three.js JavaScript library. 
These tools enable the creation of immersive experiences within web browsers.

To generate 3D avatars, Brian makes use of a service called Ready Player Me. 
This third-party software generates avatars based on user-provided pictures, allowing for the creation of personalized virtual representations.

In his explanation, Brian emphasizes the significance of the UDP (User Datagram Protocol) protocol in real-time applications, particularly in the realm of video games. 
UDP operates by continuously sending packets, regardless of whether they successfully reach their destination or when they do so. 
This constant transmission is crucial for maintaining real-time interaction and responsiveness in dynamic applications.

Brian's expertise and passion for virtual reality prototyping shine through as he shares his knowledge of the prototyping process, tools, and the role of UDP in real-time applications.
